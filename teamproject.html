  <p id="yaco">You are currently on Team Projects</p>

  <p>The purpose of the teamworking project was to allow us to workcollaboratively within a group to plan, design, implement, test, andevaluate a computing project.</p>
  <p>We had to produce a project in response to a project brief. The project hadto be completed by a project team working together, but with each of ushaving defined areas of responsibility.</p>
  <p>The project allowed us the opportunity to demonstrate the <a href="https://uk.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/teamwork-skills">knowledge and skills</a> we have accumulated across the academic year. It also gave us theopportunity to further develop key skills in planning, decision making,working with others, communications, implementation, problem solving,time management, testing and evaluation.</p>
